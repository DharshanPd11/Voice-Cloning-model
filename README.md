# Voice-Cloning-model
The model is capable of cloning any voices 

Assignment -2:
*The model is built using a pre-trained program named Tortoise text-to-speech(open source).
*This is comparatively easy to use than other pre-trained models.
*I have used it in Google collaboratory which is the most convinient way to train/test simple ML models.

Steps:
*Open Google Colab notebook
*A GPU is required to run this model. So make sure to turn on GPU in runtime settings in Colab notebook.
*Copy this code and paste it and run the cells.
*it will start installing the dependencies and required packages/libraries.
*Then, you need to give input audio files(atleast two audios), these files should be in .wav format.
*After uploading audio files the program will feed it to the model and the gives the output cloned audio(will take time).
